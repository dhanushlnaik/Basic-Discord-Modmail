<h1 align="center">Welcome to Basic Modmail 👋</h1>

> A Discord Modmail Bot made with modern JavaScript.
> It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users in a seamless way.

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/dhanushlnaik/Basic-Discord-Modmail/edit/main/README.md)

## How does it work?
When a member sends a direct message to the bot, Modmail will create a channel into a designated category. All further DM messages will automatically relay to that channel; any available staff can respond within the channel.

## Features
* Ticket number,
* Anonymous reply,
* Block users,
* Put a thread on hold,
* 10-seconds timeout before deleting a thread's channel,
* Notify the author when pausing and unpausing a thread,
* Display the thread author's User ID,
* Logs (blocked, unblocked users, closed and opened tickets) (Set your channel).
* Close tickets and delete channels when a member leaves.
* Custom Message Snippet.
